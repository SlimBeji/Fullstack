## üìÅ Key Directories

-   `models/` ‚Äì Data modeling: schemas, collections, CRUD logic, and example seed data
-   `api/` ‚Äì FastAPI server setup: auth, middlewares, OpenAPI Swagger metadata, and REST routes
-   `types/` ‚Äì Shared types, enums, annotations and data contracts
-   `lib/` ‚Äì Core business logic, utility functions, and third-party service clients
-   `worker/` ‚Äì Background processing (e.g., tasks and scheduled crons)
-   `tests/` ‚Äì Unit tests
-   `scripts/` ‚Äì One-off scripts (e.g., migrations, debugging utilities)
-   `static/` ‚Äì Static assets (e.g., images, public files)

## üìå Notes

All tools were selected to be **compatible with Python's async ecosystem**, taking full advantage of **FastAPI‚Äôs ASGI architecture**. This ensures better scalability and performance by allowing concurrent processing of I/O-bound operations like DB access, API calls, and background jobs.

-   **Beanie + Motor** were chosen for interacting with MongoDB in an async-friendly manner.
-   **Dramatiq** handles background jobs and scheduled tasks. It integrates well with async workflows and message brokers like Redis or RabbitMQ.
-   **FastAPI** automatically generates Swagger and ReDoc documentation from Pydantic models and endpoint definitions.

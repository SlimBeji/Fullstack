# üöÄ FastAPI Backend

This backend is written in **Python** and follows the architecture and principles defined in the root `README.md`.

## üßπ Linting

This backend uses the following tools to ensure clean and consistent Python code:

-   **[mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/):** Static type checker for Python. It analyzes type hints and ensures functions, variables, and class attributes follow the expected types.  
    This is especially useful in larger codebases and when using tools like **Pydantic** or **FastAPI** where typing is essential.
-   **[autoflake](https://pypi.org/project/autoflake/):** Removes unused imports and variables.
-   **[isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/):** Automatically sorts imports.  
    Configured to work with `black` formatting (see `.isort.cfg`).
-   **[black](https://black.readthedocs.io/):** Opinionated code formatter for Python.

## üìÅ Key Directories

-   `models/` ‚Äì Data modeling: schemas, collections, CRUD logic, and example seed data
-   `api/` ‚Äì FastAPI server setup: auth, middlewares, OpenAPI Swagger metadata, and REST routes
-   `types/` ‚Äì Shared types, enums, annotations and data contracts
-   `lib/` ‚Äì Core business logic, utility functions, and third-party service clients
-   `worker/` ‚Äì Background processing (e.g., tasks and scheduled crons)
-   `tests/` ‚Äì Unit tests
-   `scripts/` ‚Äì One-off scripts (e.g., migrations, debugging utilities)
-   `static/` ‚Äì Static assets (e.g., images, public files)

## üìå Notes

All tools were selected to be **compatible with Python's async ecosystem**, taking full advantage of **FastAPI‚Äôs ASGI architecture**. This ensures better scalability and performance by allowing concurrent processing of I/O-bound operations like DB access, API calls, and background jobs.

-   **Beanie + Motor** were chosen for interacting with MongoDB in an async-friendly manner.
-   **Dramatiq** handles background jobs and scheduled tasks. It integrates well with async workflows and message brokers like Redis or RabbitMQ.
-   **FastAPI** automatically generates Swagger and ReDoc documentation from Pydantic models and endpoint definitions.

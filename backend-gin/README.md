## üîê Environment Variables

The Gin backend relies on a `gin.env` file for configuration.

## üßπ Linting

The official go `fmt` package is used for code formatting. No additional utility for linting.

## üìÅ Key Directories

The root directory contains the following key directories and files:

-   `internal/` ‚Äì Contains the main application source code, following the structure defined in the root **README.md**.
-   `cmd/` ‚Äì Contains entrypoints for running scripts, schedulers, and background task handlers.
-   `app.go` ‚Äì The API server entrypoint.

> For a better development experience, hot reload is enabled in development using [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air). However, **air** does not work well if the entrypoint is placed in the `cmd/` folder. For this reason, the API server entrypoint (`app.go`) is kept separate from other `cmd` entries.

### üìÅüìÅ Internals

-   `config/` ‚Äì Environment variables and global parameters setup
-   `models/` ‚Äì Data modeling: schemas, collections, CRUD logic, and example seed data
-   `api/` ‚Äì Gin server setup: auth, middlewares, swagger config and REST routes
-   `types_/` ‚Äì Shared types and data contracts. An underscore `_` suffix was added to avoid conflict with go types
-   `lib/` ‚Äì Core business logic, utility functions, and third-party service clients
-   `worker/` ‚Äì Background processing (e.g., tasks and scheduled crons)
-   `tests/` ‚Äì Unit tests
-   `scripts/` ‚Äì One-off scripts (e.g., migrations, debugging utilities)
-   `static/` ‚Äì Static assets (e.g., images, public files)

## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Commands

The following `make` commands help manage the Gin backend:

| Command                  | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make gin-build`         | Build the Docker container for the Gin service.                                           |
| `make gin-bash`          | Open an interactive shell inside the running Gin container.                               |
| `make gin-test`          | Run unit tests using.                                                                     |
| `make gin-swagger`       | Run go swag init command and generate OpenAPI specifiications for Swagger UI              |
| `make gin-generate`      | Run go generate ./... for metaprogramming                                                 |
| `make gin-lint`          | Run go generate + swag init + go fmt + go build to make sure format + compilation is good |
| `make gin-script/‚ü®name‚ü©` | Execute a script from `scripts/` directory (e.g. `make fastapi-script/foo`).              |
| `make gin-debug`         | Run `debug.go` for debugging or manual testing.                                           |
| `make gin-seed`          | Run `seed_db.go` to populate the database with seed data.                                 |
| `make gin-dump`          | Run `dump_db.go` to export the database contents.                                         |

## üìå Notes

### Metaprogramming

Go is a statically typed language and lacks advanced metaprogramming features like Rust‚Äôs macros. Writing HTTP schemas for an API backend can therefore become verbose, especially due to the repetitive definition of validation rules and metadata (e.g., Swagger documentation) for each field.

A single model field is often reused across multiple schemas (e.g., **read**, **create**, **update**), and redefining its metadata each time quickly becomes cumbersome.

To address this, all field metadata are defined once in YAML files under `/models/fields`. Using **AST parsing** and the **`go generate`** utility, raw schema definitions are automatically transformed into fully annotated schemas, eliminating metadata repetition.

The AST parsing logic is implemented in `/internal/models/raw/astparser`.

### CRUD

Unlike the **FastAPI** and **Express** backends, the `models/collections` and `models/crud` packages are structured differently.

The `models/crud` folder contains five files ‚Äî `create.go`, `read.go`, `fetch.go`, `update.go`, and `delete.go`.
Each file defines an interface that a **collection struct** must implement to use the corresponding CRUD methods.

The `models/collections` folder provides the concrete implementations of these interfaces, along with additional helper methods specific to each model.

## üìÅ Key Directories

-   `models/` ‚Äì Data modeling: schemas, collections, CRUD logic, and example seed data
-   `api/` ‚Äì Express server setup: auth, middlewares, OpenAPI docs, and REST routes
-   `types/` ‚Äì Shared types, enums, interfaces, and module extensions (e.g., `express.d.ts`)
-   `lib/` ‚Äì Core business logic, utility functions, and third-party service clients
-   `worker/` ‚Äì Background processing (e.g., tasks and scheduled crons)
-   `tests/` ‚Äì Unit tests
-   `scripts/` ‚Äì One-off scripts (e.g., migrations, debugging utilities)
-   `static/` ‚Äì Static assets (e.g., images, public files)

## üìå Notes

-   Swagger documentation is auto-generated from Zod schemas using `zod-to-openapi` and served via `swagger-ui-express`.
-   Background jobs are processed via BullMQ with Redis as the broker.
-   Scheduled tasks (cron jobs) are powered by `node-cron`.
